# What the hostel?

- Classes & Overthinking


# Frameworks

MVC -> Pattern where we use Models, Views and Controllers

Model: Representations of real world thing Post, Author
Controller: Interactions that we can do with a model
View: A way for the user to interface with the controller and the model

# Programming style

- OOP - Ruby 
- Functional -> Immutables functions grouped together
- Imperative


class PotatoJS {
  constructor(){
    this.bob = "AH YISSS"
  }
}

const somePotato = new PotatoJS

somePotato.bob


New is always better
